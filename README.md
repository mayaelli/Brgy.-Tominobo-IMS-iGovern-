iGovern: Barangay Tominobo Information Management System

Overview
The Barangay Tominobo Information Management System (IMS) is a web-based platform designed to streamline administrative processes, enhance resident profiling, and facilitate event management, document handling, and data analytics for improved barangay governance.

This system offers features for secure user authentication, resident data management, event scheduling, document storage, and visual data analysis, making it easier to manage barangay activities and decisions.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login for different roles (admin, superadmin) with role-based access control.
Resident Management: Allows for adding, editing, and viewing resident profiles.
Event Management: Set and manage upcoming barangay events with an integrated calendar.
Document Management: Superadmin can upload, view, print, and download official documents.
Data Analytics: Visualizes resident demographics (age, sex, civil status, etc.) for data-driven decision-making.
